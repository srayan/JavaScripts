Web based application development


This is a web application based project; developed as a part of the Object Oriented Analysis and Design course, Spring 2014.

The primary goal is to allow the user to select a class id. 
Based on the class id selected from the first drop-down, a second drop-down menu will appear, which will be populated with the dates corresponding to the class selected.
The user can select a valid date from this second drop-down.

The options for selecting a class and a corresponding date is pre-coded, so the possibility of the user entering incorrect information / combination is removed.

As an effort towards a smarter design, once the user selects a valid set of class - date combination, the result will automatically pop up in a new window. No "click" button has been added here.

The application is coded using Javascript on a HTML based layout.

As an additional feature, the application has been deployed on a server, and assigned the domain name www.ooad6359.tk.
One can access this website through a computer, smart-phone or a tablet. Please ensure that your pop-up blocker is disabled, otherwise the resultant pop-up will be suppressed by your browser.
